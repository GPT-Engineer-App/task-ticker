# task-ticker

hi, can you please create a countdown clock (for focusing) depending on the task selected: Emails (30 mins)/ review (60 min)/ calculation (60min) / research (60min)/ deep focus (90 min)/ sketching (30min)/ break (10min). Once the count down begins the screen turns black and numbers turn pixelated. One the countdown is completed for the first 10 seconds the screen turns blue and green with a message 'Time's Up'
